        <h2>A Quick, Easy, and Healthy Take on a Favorite of Rural Mexican Cuisine</h2>
          <p>Throughout Mexico's countryside, you can bet that many families start their day by eating some good ole' huevos rancheros. 
            The dish's enduring status as a staple of rustic cuisine is thanks in large part to its nutritiousness, deliciousness, and simplicity. 
            What if I told you that there was a way to make this dish simpler, more nutritious, and, well, just as delicious?</p>
          <p>Okay, maybe I lied when I said I would make this dish taste just as delicious as traditional huevos rancheros; that is because, for the sake of time
            and health, I have chosen to remove some of the more superfluous (yet delicious) ingredients usually found in this dish and make some key substitutions to 
            get the most "bang for your buck". If you were to make regular huevos rancheros, you would almost certainly include ingredients such as avocado, refried beans,
            and shredded cheese. While, yes, these items are quite delectable, they contain <em>high amounts of fat</em>, meaning that they are <strong>more calorically-dense</strong> than their
            protein and carbohydrate compatriots.</p>
          <p>Simply put, this recipe is for those trying to eat something nutritious and delicious. This dish contains a whole bunch of <strong>complex carbohydrates, 
            high-quality protein, and healthy fats.</strong> The relatively short list of ingredients will also be useful for those who are on a budget and want to save some time.
            You only need 4 ingredients to make this recipe possible!</p>
