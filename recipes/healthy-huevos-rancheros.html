        <h2>A Quick, Easy, and Healthy Take on a Favorite of Rural Mexican Cuisine</h2>
          <p>Throughout Mexico's countryside, you can bet that many families start their day by eating some good ole' huevos rancheros. 
            The dish's enduring status as a staple of rustic cuisine is thanks in large part to its simplicity, nutritiousness, and deliciousness. 
            What if I told you that there was a way to make this dish simpler, more nutritious, and, well, just as delicious?</p>
          <p>Okay, maybe I lied when I said I would make this dish taste just as delicious as traditional huevos rancheros; that is because, for the sake of time
            and health, I have chosen to remove some of the more superfluous (yet delicious) ingredients usually found in this dish and make some key substitutions to 
            get the most "bang for your buck". If you were to make regular huevos rancheros, you would almost certainly include ingredients such as avocado, refried beans,
            and shredded cheese. While, yes, these items are quite delectable, they contain <em>high amounts of fat</em>, meaning that they are <strong>more calorically-dense</strong> than their
            protein and carbohydrate compatriots.</p>
          <p>Simply put, this recipe is for those trying to eat something nutritious and delicious. This dish contains a whole bunch of <strong>complex carbohydrates, 
            high-quality protein, and healthy fats.</strong> The relatively short list of ingredients will also be useful for those who are on a budget and want to save some time.
            You only need 4 ingredients to make this recipe possible!</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>1 whole wheat flour tortilla</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 or 1/3 of can of black beans</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons of chunky salsa</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That's it! Those are the only ingredients you need for a more stripped down, less calorically-dense version of huevos rancheros. Lovers of the original dish
                will probably shake their heads in disapproval upon reading this list but I promise that it still tastes delicious! If you want a breakfast that is high in
                "slow-burn" carbohydrates, protein, and fiber, then all you have to do is stock up on the four ingredients listed above!</p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Take 1 can of black beans and wash/drain them in a strainer. This helps to remove excess moisture and sodium that we don't need.</li>
                <li>Place 1 whole wheat flour tortilla on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave for 10-15 seconds or until the tortilla is warm and tender.</li>
                <li>Remove tortilla once thoroughly heated and have it ready for plating.</li>
                <li>Add 2 large eggs to a non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook these eggs as desired (i.e. sunny side up, over-easy, fried, etc.).</li>
                <li>Remove cooked eggs from the pan and place them on the tortilla.</li>
                <li>In the same pan, add 1/2 or 1/3 of the can of black beans. Add the same time, add 4 tablespoons of chunky salsa to the pan.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat down to low/medium-low and continue to cook the beans and salsa until most of the moisture from the salsa has evaporated.</li>
                <li>Take the beans-and-salsa mixture and add it to the tortilla and eggs.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This should go without saying, but this recipe is not some sacred text written in stone; you can make some adjustments to your liking! If you want 3 eggs instead of 2,
                then go for it! If you want to go easy on the beans, then add a little less! If you want this dish to be bursting with even more flavor, then add a boatload of salsa! 
                The only thing I would suggest you do is avoid adding ingredients that are high in calories (e.g. butter, avocados, cheese, full-fat refried beans, etc.) As long as you
                stick to this recipe (or at least an approximation of it), then you can't possibly go wrong!
