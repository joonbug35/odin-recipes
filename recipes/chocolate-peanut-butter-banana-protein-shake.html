        <h2>A Deliciously Sweet, Milkshake-Like Protein Shake</h2>
          <p><em>This concoction will bring all of the boys to the yard</em></p>
          <p>Who doesn't love an ice-cold milkshake (excluding the lactose-intolerant among us)? I'll tell you who: sociopaths and moral degenerates.</p>
          <p>Jokes aside, anyone who has eaten at a diner or any diner-adjacent restaurant has most likely had a milkshake in their life and who can blame them? When you're going to
            town on that burger and shoving french fries in your gullet, what's more appealing than washing it all down with a thick and sweet milkshake? Not much, to be quite honest.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, milkshakes are calorie-bombs of a magnitude so great, that they would make the foremost minds of the Manhattan Project cower in fear. 
            What can you expect when you mix ice cream, full-fat milk, sugar, and whole bunch of other sweet confections? What makes milkshakes particularly troublesome for the 
            waistline is the fact that they're mostly liquid: liquid foods are nowhere nearly as satiating as solid foods. You can easily chug an 800-calorie milkshake in 10 
            seconds flat and it will do next to nothing to satisfy your hunger. This, on top of the fact that milkshakes are primarily consumed <em>in conjunction with high-calorie foods
            like hamburgers and french fries</em>, makes milkshakes something you definitely should avoid if you are watching your weight.</p>
          <p>What if you could make something taste just as good as a milkshake, in the comfort of your own home, with a fraction of the calories? I've got the solution. By
            making a couple of sensible substitutions to the traditional milkshake, we can have a thick and creamy beverage that can actually be considered pretty darn
            nutritious.</p>
