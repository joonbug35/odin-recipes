        <h2>A Low-Calorie, Low-Cost Nutritious Breakfast</h2>
          <p>This dish is so easy to make and so nutritious, it's not even funny. If you're looking for a <em>low-calorie, high-protein, and fiber-rich </em> recipe, then
        you've come to the right place. This dish only needs <strong>FOUR</strong> ingredients to make.</p>
          <p>I'll be the first to admit that this dish is not glamorous nor mind-blowingly delicious; however, this recipe was not meant for flavor-junkies. It's specifically for 
            people on a budget who want to make a nutritious meal <em>in a matter of minutes</em>. All you're going to need is a non-stick frying pan and the ingredients listed below. 
          </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>4-6 egg whites</li>
                <li>1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of chunky salsa</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All these ingredients add up to a healthy serving of <strong>monounsaturated fats, high-quality protein, and vegetables</strong>. The frozen mixed vegetables, 
                coupled with the chunky salsa, provide plenty of <strong>fiber</strong> to promote <em>satiety</em> and <em>digestive health</em>. Not only that, the salsa also provides
                the desperately-needed flavor for this recipe that makes it worthwhile!</p>
