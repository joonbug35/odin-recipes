        <h2>A Low-Calorie, Low-Cost Nutritious Breakfast</h2>
          <p>This dish is so easy to make and so nutritious, it's not even funny. If you're looking for a <em>low-calorie, high-protein, and fiber-rich </em> recipe, then
        you've come to the right place. This dish only needs <strong>FOUR</strong> ingredients to make.</p>
          <p>I'll be the first to admit that this dish is not glamorous nor mind-blowingly delicious; however, this recipe was not meant for flavor-junkies. It's specifically for 
            people on a budget who want to make a nutritious meal <em>in a matter of minutes</em>. All you're going to need is a non-stick frying pan and the ingredients listed below. 
          </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>4-6 egg whites</li>
                <li>1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of chunky salsa</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All these ingredients add up to a healthy serving of <strong>monounsaturated fats, high-quality protein, and vegetables</strong>. The frozen mixed vegetables, 
                coupled with the chunky salsa, provide plenty of <strong>fiber</strong> to promote <em>satiety</em> and <em>digestive health</em>. Not only that, the salsa also provides
                the desperately-needed flavor for this recipe that makes it worthwhile!</p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to a non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables to the pan. Stir the vegetables around the pan to ensure that the mixture is evenly coated with oil. 
                    Cover the pan and cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                <em>You don't have to defrost the vegetables; adding them frozen is perfectly fine.</em>
                <li>Remove lid and stir vegetables. Make sure they are thoroughly softened. If not, cover and cook for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 4-6 egg whites to the vegetables. Immediately turn heat up to medium and cover the pan for 1-2 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove lid and start stirring the vegetable and egg white mixture.</li>
                <em>At this point, the egg whites should be fully cooked <strong>on the bottom</strong>; you want to ensure that is the case before stirring if you want to
                    avoid a sticky mess</em>
                <li>While stirring egg whites and vegetables, add 1/2 cup of chunky salsa to the pan</li>
                <em>The salsa not only adds flavor to the dish but it also "deglazes" the pan, if you will; egg whites are notorious for sticking to even non-stick cookware
                    so the liquid-y salsa should help remedy this somewhat.</em>
                <li>Continue to stir egg whites, vegetables, and salsa until the salsa has been mostly absorbed by the vegetables and egg whites.</li>
                <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
              </ol>
                <p>And there you have it! A simple, satisfactorily tasty dish packed with protein and fiber that serves as a great breakfast to start your day. It's a low
                    maintenance dish that will easily fill anyone up, mostly due to all those vegetables! You might notice that there's no salt and pepper in this recipe; that's because of
                    the salsa! Any decent salsa, fresh or otherwise, is going to have plenty of savory ingredients like onions, garlic, and hot peppers that provide plenty of flavor on their
                    own. Truth be told, salt and pepper are simply not necessary for this dish! Will adding them make them taste better? Probably, yeah, but the point is you don't need them!
